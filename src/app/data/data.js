In 2019, she made waves by breaking the 100 m collegiate record at the NCAA Division I Championships, clocking an impressive time of 10.75 seconds. Throughout her career, Richardson has consistently shown her speed and agility, reaching new milestones along the way. In April 2021, she ran a personal best of 10.72 seconds, making her the sixth-fastest woman of all time at that time and the fourth-fastest American woman in history. This stellar performance secured her a spot in the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she qualified in the women's 100-meter dash with a time of 10.86 seconds at the United States Olympic Trials.\n\nUnfortunately, Richardson's journey to the Olympics took an unexpected turn when she tested positive for cannabis use after her 100 m final at the U.S. Trials. As a result, her win was invalidated, and she was deemed ineligible to compete in the 100 m at the Olympics. Accepting a one-month period of ineligibility starting on June 28, 2021, Richardson faced a setback but never lost her determination.\n\nIn July 2023, Richardson proved her resilience and regained her position as a dominant force on the track. She became the US national champion in the women's 100 meters at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, displaying her incredible speed by running 10.82 seconds. Her success continued at the 2023 World Championships, where she reached new heights. Richardson won gold in the 100 m, setting a new championship record of 10.65 seconds, solidifying her place among the world's elite sprinters. Furthermore, she contributed to Team USA's success by winning gold in the women's 4x100m relay, setting another championship record of 41.03 seconds.\n\nRichardson's dominance in the track and field extends beyond these recent achievements. As a teenager, she was already making her mark by winning the 100 m title at the AAU Junior Olympics in 2016 and the USATF Junior Olympics in 2017. Again, in 2019, Richardson left her mark in the collegiate sphere by setting a record in the 100 m and breaking Allyson Felix's record in the 200 m at the NCAA Division I Outdoor Championships.
