### Goal

Athletics Hub is a comprehensive platform designed with the track fan in mind. Our goal is to create an all-in-one hub for track and field enthusiasts to stay connected with the sport throughout the season. Currently, we have indexed the top 800 male and female athletes globally and have plans to expand this coverage to include all potential competitors in the Paris 2024 Olympics.

### The Project

When searching for an athlete, Athletics Hub aims to provide answers to key questions:

1. What are this athlete's main events?
2. What are this athlete's most recent results?
3. What's the backstory of this athlete?
4. Who are the athlete's top competitors?
5. What are this athlete's personal bests?
6. What are this athlete's most notable accomplishments?

While this information is available through a Google search, our project addresses common issues such as short auto-generated summaries, the lack of a live results stream, and information not tailored to a track fan's desires. This involves generating descriptive summaries by utilizing data from Instagram and Wikipedia profiles, extracting and employing generative language models for coherent and well-written summaries. Additionally, we collect and display data from World Athletics in a visual format for easy tracking of your favorite athletes.

### Key Features

- Live stream displaying the athlete's most recent results
